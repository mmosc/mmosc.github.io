I am a physicist turned computer scientist, currently a PhD student at the
[Multimedia Mining and Search Group](https://www.hcai.at) of
the [Johannes Kepler University Linz](https://www.jku.at/en), Austria.

My (current) fields of research are **recommender systems** and **music information retrieval**. I have a PhD in
theoretical particle physics.

I love understanding and discussing maths and science. I have a passion for music and books. I enjoy doing sports. I
have a thing for languages.
